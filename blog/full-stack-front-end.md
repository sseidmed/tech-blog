I recently finished Full Stack for Front End Developers V2 course on Front End Masters. I am in love with Front End Masters platform, by the way. Later I found out that V3 has been filmed so I will have to watch that too.

I mostly work with Vue.js and Flask at my job, so I rarely get to work on things that don't involve those frameworks. This course helped me understand a little of many different things. At the beginning it covers the basics such as how Internet works, domain names, and basics of command line. Jem takes you from setting up your own server on Digital Ocean with ssh (secure socket shell) to having a simple Express app run with nginx with a certificate. I used name.com to buy my domain name. 

After setting up nginx, which is a web server, Jem discusses application architecture and why it's so important to know for a senior engineer. Once you create a simple Express app, you set nginx to proxy pass to correct port. What happens if your server down? In order to keep your app server running, you need a process manager. In this course, you will install and use pm2. One of the last big topics that was discussed is https and certification. You will use certbot to add a certification to your website. Jem also talks about the history of http and why it's important to use https for our security.

Lastly, Jem briefly talks about a variety of subjects without going deep. For instance, containers like Docker and Kubernetes, load balancers and web sockets. There is a very tiny exercise on web sockets at the end. All those subjects are worthy of taking several others courses or reading a few books.

There is a version 3 available on Front End Masters. It is not edited yet. I look forward to completing that as well.
